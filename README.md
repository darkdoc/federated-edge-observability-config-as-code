# Federated Edge Observability Config As Code Repo

## What is this?

This provides an Ansible Automation Platform config-as-code repository to run the Federated Edge Observability Validated Pattern.

## How do I get started?

1. The concepts here are derived from those in the Ansible Edge GitOps Validated Pattern.
1. Check out the Federated Open Telemetry [repository](https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/federated-open-telemetry), which will use this repository by default as the config-as-code repo
